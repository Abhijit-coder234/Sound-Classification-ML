# Sound-Classification-ML
Implementation of Sound Classification by supervised learning model using python through CNN 


Classification is the ability of a system to identify an image into its specific category
with an acceptable classification accuracy score. This project is able to convert the given
audio to images and use these images as data to train the model to perform classification
on a new audio signal. Deep learning with deep neural networks is implemented in this
project which makes the system more accurate and reliable.
The main objective of this project is to devise a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for a
footstep classification system that can categorize a given audio sample into three different
categories. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the type of Deep Neural Network
employed in this project, which is trained using the generated mel-spectrogram images.
With the help of TensorFlow the network is designed and imported into python. The
system is designed to perform various tasks as this language provides many predefined
functions such as ImageDataGenerator, callbacks, Librosa and, Sklearn giving a strong
platform for implementation and provides a continuous interface between the user and
the computer system.
Using ImageDataGenerator, the system is able to automatically label the images as
structured in the dataset, which is processed by the neural network. The neural network is
devised by choosing the best possible learning rate and number of iterations to train using
the dataset. Softmax function is used to decide the most appropriate learning rate which
is obtained by comparing the graph of basic softmax function with the obtained graph.
As a result, two Convolutional Neural Networks are trained with an accuracy ranging
between 75-95 %. Different models were also compared the in process to demonstrate a
comparative analysis.A footstep classification using a deep neural network is designed to
perform different tasks which have environmental and security applications.
